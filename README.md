# Android MySQL Tutorial to Perform Basic CRUD Operation

In this project we will learn the basic CRUD operation in MySQL database from Android Application. 

## What is CRUD?
Creating a Record -> In the database we insert a record.

Reading Stored Records -> No point of saving data when we canâ€™t read it back  So the second operation is reading the stored data back.

Updating Stored Records -> We may also need to update the existing data. So the third operation is update.

Deleting Records -> Lastly we may also need to delete the existing data from the database.

So basically in any database we perform the above mentioned operations. In this tutorial I am going to use MySQL and PHP.
## Building Web APIs
The first step is building the required Web APIs. This is because from the android application, to communicate with our web server we need an interface called API.

So our android device will send a request to our API,  then our API will perform the requested task and it will give us the response related to the task. You can see the below diagram for more clarification.
